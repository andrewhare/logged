# logged

A ridiculously simple Go logging package that has a minimalist interface, fast JSON output, and follows the thought process of [Dave Cheney's discussion on logging](https://dave.cheney.net/2015/11/05/lets-talk-about-logging) as close as possible.

# Installation

```
$ go get github.com/andrewhare/logged
```
